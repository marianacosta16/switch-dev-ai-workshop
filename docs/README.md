# RAG source documents

Put the PDF files you want to ask questions about in this folder, then run:

```bash
npm run ingest
```

## What to put here

- Public documents (open technical manuals, public standards summaries, open specifications) or your own notes.
- Documents with selectable text. Scanned PDFs (images of pages) have no extractable text and will be skipped with a warning.

## What not to put here

- Confidential or work documents.
- Copyrighted material you are not allowed to share.

PDF files in this folder are git-ignored, so they stay on your machine and are never pushed to GitHub.
